# serverless_application

In this project, you will build a serverless reminder application. The application will be hosted in an S3 bucket and executed within a browser, interfacing with Lambda and Step Functions via an API Gateway Endpoint. This app enables users to configure reminders for 'pet cuddles' to be sent via email.
